# Simple Compile Sample

To compile contract to Java, execute:
```
node compile simple.sol java
```

It outputs the generated code to console.

To compile contract to C#, execute:
```
node compile simple.sol csharp
```

This is a proof of concept, to be completed. One possible final outcome could be a new programming language like Solidity but
with good compilation support to general programming languages.
